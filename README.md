+ About the Project: Collaborative filtering refers to the process of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). In this project, our team has applied memory-based algorithm and model-based algorithm working on the Microsoft Web Dataset and EachMovie Dataset. In the memory-based algorithm, we used Spearman correlation, Vector similarity and SimRank to calculate the similarity weight; weight threshold, best-n-estimator and combined in selecting neighbours. In the model-based algorithm, we applied cluster models. 
+ For the cluter models, we split train data to 90% train dataset and 10% validation set. We randomly select 700 initial parameter vector and run EM algorithm to find MLE with C++ code. The result was accurate and efficent(with test MAE1.007, with less than 2 hours).

+ Following are result analysis of different combinations of memory-based algorithm and model-based algorithm:
